# Pre-processing of theme settings
1. Install Extension Manager

　From Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), type the following to install gnome-shell-extension-manager. (do not include $)  
  
	$ sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager

2. Install User Themes

Launch the Extension Manager, search for "User Themes" in the "Find" tab, and click the "Add" button to install. 
Go to the "Added" tab and you will see that "User Themes" has been registered. First, activate the Extension by setting the button on the header to "ON" (to the right). Next, turn on the button to the right of "User Themes" as well. This will allow you to change the GNOME Shell theme.
 
. Install and prepare gnome-tweaks

　Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type the following to apply and gnome-tweaks will be installed. (Terminal~$)

    $ sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
  
Launch GNOME Tweaks and see.  If you look at the Appearance > GNOME Shell section, you will see a selection button to change the user theme.

(See: Gnome-Shell-Extention is no longer available due to FireFox snap. In the appendix, I will write PPA for Deb installation of FireFox, etc. Please see).
