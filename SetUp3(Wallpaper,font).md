# Moe-ify the font

Find a Kawaii font. Unzip the font data and put it into the ".fonts" folder in your home folder. If you cannot find the ".fonts" folder, create a new one.  
Now, open "GNOME Tweaks", open the "Fonts" tab, and set the following  

	Interface text: (font name)
	Document text: (font name)
	Legacy window title: (font name)
